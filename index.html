      Connect our frontend JavaScript application to curl-like LLM API calls
    </p>

    <h2>TL;DR:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Our result will be 100% done in JavaScript, using (React-like) Preact
        library and calling AI API directly with simple fetch calls.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use AI in static frontend build: this means one index.html file
        and one JavaScript file. Nothing else, all below 10KB.
      </li>
      <li>
        No python anywhere. Everything is and will be done in normal JavaScript
        like we have been doing for decades.
      </li>

      <li>
        No need to install anything, application we create in this step is
        already running <a href="#live">below</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Free models on Groq work a lot faster than those charging money for
        slowness.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>
      The first step in our journey of reimplementing a fully functional OpenAGI
      platform is about connecting our JavaScript application to LLM API.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you know how to build the system itself, you know best how to use it
      and why it works the way it does.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implementing our own backend will happen much later, when we will need a
      system that runs in the background without you having a browser window
      open.<br />It will be generating new results in the background, and then
      sending them to you, when you open the application in your browser.<br />
      This adds huge amount of complexity overhead and is not needed for our
      live "hands on" experiments we are building here, so we will skip it for
      now.
    </p>

    <h2>Buyer beware</h2>

    <p>
      Scammers try to oversell you their "AI" products by charging you huge
      markups on paid API calls, some even worse, reaching infinity% markup on
      the free 0$ per token API usage. <br />That's the real reason why they
      "must" have a server. They're reselling essentially free service,
      "providing" a cheap wordpress template around the real value: API
      response.<br />
      Why do you think there is a new "revolutionary" "AI" application released
      every day? Because printing text from LLM API through a template does not
      take a real developer to create.
      <br />They also conveniently never release their backend code as Open
      source, wonder why... because there was never anything of any real value
      there in the first place?
    </p>

    <p>
      Purpose of this step is to prove you can use AI for free without having
      any server at all and how easy is using AI in the real world, when done
      with right technologies and approaches.<br />
      This means: without all useless python garbage "tutorials" floating around
      reinventing the wheel 10 times over just to get a simple AI response
      printed to our web page after 45 seconds.

    <h2>Live application</h2>

    <p>
      We can use AI models for free, forever.
      <br />
      Groq API key can be generated on:
      <a href="https://console.groq.com/keys" target="_blank"
        >https://console.groq.com/keys</a
      >, simply log in with your GitHub or any email.
      <br />
      You can jump through few more hoops, to get a free API key for Google's
      models:
      <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/apikey" target="_blank"
        >https://aistudio.google.com/apikey</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      After entering your Groq API key, select a model in the dropdown. Start
      with the latest llama-3.2 models.<br />

      The size of the model will affect your generate speed, 1B is fast but less
      smart than 3B or even 90B which is a lot smarter but also slower.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you Submit, the AI will generate a response based on the prompt you
      entered. When "Loading..." is done, scroll to the bottom of the
      application to see it.
    </p>

    <p>
      API call is configured to return JSON because text in this shape makes a
      lot more sense in real programming.<br />
      JSON will be parsed to generate data for our application code in later
      steps of our tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is zero hidden big brother system prompt added or any other unasked
      for "alignment" forced on you here.<br />What you submit is precisely what
      gets sent to AI and response is precisely what AI returned. Nothing more,
      nothing less.<br />Use it as irresponsibly as you want, it is YOUR code,
      on YOUR machine, and it is YOUR decision what you will do with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to specify JSON shape yourself with a simple description "what"
      you want "where".<br />Defining JSON shape is literally
      WYSIWYG: "what you say is what you get". Garbage in garbage out.<br />Asking
      for "use JSON format" is good for start, but not enough as it is unstable
      in the long run. Keys might change names or locations.<br />You will not
      know on which names to rely to find what you asked for when programming.
      Be specific on names and shapes (array, object, number, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
      Compare the quality of responses using different models. Submit again to
      use the new model with the same prompt.
    </p>

    <p>
      ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can use the same API key for all models, no need to create a
      new one.
    </p>

    <p>
      All inputs are saved in your browser's local storage so you don't have to
      enter API key again next time you visit the page.
