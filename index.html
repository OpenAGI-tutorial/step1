    <h1>OpenAGI 101 - Step 1</h1>

    <h2>TL;DR:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>You DO NOT need a server to use AI in your web page.</li>
      <li>
        No python allowed anywhere. Everything is and will be done in normal
        JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        Free models on Groq work a lot faster than those charging money for
        slowness.
      </li>
      <li>
        You DO NOT need to install anything, application built in this step is
        allready running below.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use AI models for free. No credit card required:
        <a href="https://console.groq.com/keys" target="_blank"
          >https://console.groq.com/keys</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Live application</h2>

    <p>
      100% done in JavaScript, using Preact and calling AI API directly with
      simple fetch calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      No python, no server, no backend, no database, no paying, no nonesense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just JavaScript, 100% client side, running below without you needing to
      install anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      After entering your Groq API key, select a model in the dropdown. Start
      with the latest llama-3.2 models.<br />

      The size of the model will affect your generate speed, 1B is fast but less
      smart than 3B or even 90B which is a lot smarter but also slower.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you Submit, the AI will generate a response based on the prompt you
      entered. When "Loading..." is done, scroll to the bottom of the
      application to see it.
    </p>

    <p>
      API call is configured to return JSON because text in this shape makes a
      lot more sense in real programming.<br />
      JSON will be parsed to generate data for our application code in later
      steps of our tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is zero system prompt added, you need to specify JSON shape yourself
      with a simple description "what" you want "where" in the response.<br />Defining
      JSON shape is literally WYAIWYG: "what you ask for is what you get".
      Garbage in garbage out.<br />Asking for "use JSON format" is good for
      start, but not enough as it is unstable in the long run. Keys might change
      names or locations.<br />You will not know on which names to rely to find
      what you asked for when programming. Be specific on names and shapes
      (array, object, number, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
      Compare the quality of responses using different models. Submit again to
      use the new model with the same prompt.
    </p>

    <p>
      ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can use the same API key for all models, no need to create a
      new one.

      Key is saved in your browser's local storage so you don't have to enter it
      again next time you visit the page. Try refreshing.
